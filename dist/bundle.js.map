For example:\n\t *\n\t *                                            <Paper>\n\t *  <Paper>                                     <div> // See notice\n\t *    <BeforeAfterWrapper>        renders         <div/> // before element\n\t *      [children of paper]       ------>         [children of paper]\n\t *    </BeforeAfterWrapper>                       <div/> // after element\n\t *  </Paper>                                    </div>\n\t *                                            </Paper>\n\t *\n\t *  Notice: Notice that this div bundles together our elements. If the element\n\t *    that we want to apply before and after elements is a HTML tag (i.e. a\n\t *    div, p, or button tag), we can avoid this extra nesting by passing using\n\t *    the BeforeAfterWrapper in place of said tag like so:\n\t *\n\t *  <p>\n\t *    <BeforeAfterWrapper>   do this instead   <BeforeAfterWrapper elementType='p'>\n\t *      [children of p]          ------>         [children of p]\n\t *    </BeforeAfterWrapper>                    </BeforeAfterWrapper>\n\t *  </p>\n\t *\n\t *  BeforeAfterWrapper features spread functionality. This means that we can\n\t *  pass HTML tag properties directly into the BeforeAfterWrapper tag.\n\t *\n\t *  When using BeforeAfterWrapper, ensure that the parent of the beforeElement\n\t *  and afterElement have a defined style position.\n\t */\n\t\n\tvar styles = {\n\t  box: {\n\t    boxSizing: 'border-box'\n\t  }\n\t};\n\t\n\tvar BeforeAfterWrapper = function (_Component) {\n\t  _inherits(BeforeAfterWrapper, _Component);\n\t\n\t  function BeforeAfterWrapper() {\n\t    _classCallCheck(this, BeforeAfterWrapper);\n\t\n\t    return _possibleConstructorReturn(this, Object.getPrototypeOf(BeforeAfterWrapper).apply(this, arguments));\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  _createClass(BeforeAfterWrapper, [{\n\t    key: 'render',\n\t    value: function render() {\n\t      var _props = this.props;\n\t      var beforeStyle = _props.beforeStyle;\n\t      var afterStyle = _props.afterStyle;\n\t      var beforeElementType = _props.beforeElementType;\n\t      var // eslint-disable-line no-unused-vars\n\t      afterElementType = _props.afterElementType;\n\t      var // eslint-disable-line no-unused-vars\n\t      elementType = _props.elementType;\n\t\n\t      var other = _objectWithoutProperties(_props, ['beforeStyle', 'afterStyle', 'beforeElementType', 'afterElementType', 'elementType']);\n\t\n\t      var prepareStyles = this.context.muiTheme.prepareStyles;\n\t\n\t\n\t      var beforeElement = void 0;\n\t      var afterElement = void 0;\n\t\n\t      if (beforeStyle) {\n\t        beforeElement = _react2.default.createElement(this.props.beforeElementType, {\n\t          style: prepareStyles((0, _simpleAssign2.default)({}, styles.box, beforeStyle)),\n\t          key: '::before'\n\t        });\n\t      }\n\t\n\t      if (afterStyle) {\n\t        afterElement = _react2.default.createElement(this.props.afterElementType, {\n\t          style: prepareStyles((0, _simpleAssign2.default)({}, styles.box, afterStyle)),\n\t          key: '::after'\n\t        });\n\t      }\n\t\n\t      var children = [beforeElement, this.props.children, afterElement];\n\t\n\t      var props = other;\n\t      props.style = prepareStyles((0, _simpleAssign2.default)({}, this.props.style));\n\t\n\t      return _react2.default.createElement(this.props.elementType, props, children);\n\t    }\n\t  }]);\n\t\n\t  return BeforeAfterWrapper;\n\t}(_react.Component);\n\t\n\tBeforeAfterWrapper.propTypes = {\n\t  afterElementType: _react.PropTypes.string,\n\t  afterStyle: _react.PropTypes.object,\n\t  beforeElementType: _react.PropTypes.string,\n\t  beforeStyle: _react.PropTypes.object,\n\t  children: _react.PropTypes.node,\n\t  elementType: _react.PropTypes.string,\n\t  /**\n\t   * Override the inline-styles of the root element.\n\t   */\n\t  style: _react.PropTypes.object\n\t};\n\tBeforeAfterWrapper.defaultProps = {\n\t  beforeElementType: 'div',\n\t  afterElementType: 'div',\n\t  elementType: 'div'\n\t};\n\tBeforeAfterWrapper.contextTypes = {\n\t  muiTheme: _react.PropTypes.object.isRequired\n\t};\n\texports.default = BeforeAfterWrapper;\n\n/***/ },\n/* 260 */\n/***/ function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\t'use strict';\n\t\n\tObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", {\n\t  value: true\n\t});\n\t\n\tvar _extends = Object.assign || function (target) { for (var i = 1; i < arguments.length; i++) { var source = arguments[i]; for (var key in source) { if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(source, key)) { target[key] = source[key]; } } } return target; };\n\t\n\tvar _createClass = function () { function defineProperties(target, props) { for (var i = 0; i < props.length; i++) { var descriptor = props[i]; descriptor.enumerable = descriptor.enumerable || false; descriptor.configurable = true; if (\"value\" in descriptor) descriptor.writable = true; Object.defineProperty(target, descriptor.key, descriptor); } } return function (Constructor, protoProps, staticProps) { if (protoProps) defineProperties(Constructor.prototype, protoProps); if (staticProps) defineProperties(Constructor, staticProps); return Constructor; }; }();\n\t\n\tvar _simpleAssign = __webpack_require__(4);\n\t\n\tvar _simpleAssign2 = _interopRequireDefault(_simpleAssign);\n\t\n\tvar _react = __webpack_require__(1);\n\t\n\tvar _react2 = _interopRequireDefault(_react);\n\t\n\tvar _reactDom = __webpack_require__(10);\n\t\n\tvar _reactDom2 = _interopRequireDefault(_reactDom);\n\t\n\tvar _shallowEqual = __webpack_require__(25);\n\t\n\tvar _shallowEqual2 = _interopRequireDefault(_shallowEqual);\n\t\n\tvar _autoPrefix = __webpack_require__(42);\n\t\n\tvar _autoPrefix2 = _interopRequireDefault(_autoPrefix);\n\t\n\tvar _transitions = __webpack_require__(6);\n\t\n\tvar _transitions2 = _interopRequireDefault(_transitions);\n\t\n\tfunction _interopRequireDefault(obj) { return obj && obj.__esModule ?

For example:\n *\n *                                            <Paper>\n *  <Paper>                                     <div> // See notice\n *    <BeforeAfterWrapper>        renders         <div/> // before element\n *      [children of paper]       ------>         [children of paper]\n *    </BeforeAfterWrapper>                       <div/> // after element\n *  </Paper>                                    </div>\n *                                            </Paper>\n *\n *  Notice: Notice that this div bundles together our elements. If the element\n *    that we want to apply before and after elements is a HTML tag (i.e. a\n *    div, p, or button tag), we can avoid this extra nesting by passing using\n *    the BeforeAfterWrapper in place of said tag like so:\n *\n *  <p>\n *    <BeforeAfterWrapper>   do this instead   <BeforeAfterWrapper elementType='p'>\n *      [children of p]          ------>         [children of p]\n *    </BeforeAfterWrapper>                    </BeforeAfterWrapper>\n *  </p>\n *\n *  BeforeAfterWrapper features spread functionality. This means that we can\n *  pass HTML tag properties directly into the BeforeAfterWrapper tag.\n *\n *  When using BeforeAfterWrapper, ensure that the parent of the beforeElement\n *  and afterElement have a defined style position.\n */\n\nvar styles = {\n  box: {\n    boxSizing: 'border-box'\n  }\n};\n\nvar BeforeAfterWrapper = function (_Component) {\n  _inherits(BeforeAfterWrapper, _Component);\n\n  function BeforeAfterWrapper() {\n    _classCallCheck(this, BeforeAfterWrapper);\n\n    return _possibleConstructorReturn(this, Object.getPrototypeOf(BeforeAfterWrapper).apply(this, arguments));\n  }\n\n  _createClass(BeforeAfterWrapper, [{\n    key: 'render',\n    value: function render() {\n      var _props = this.props;\n      var beforeStyle = _props.beforeStyle;\n      var afterStyle = _props.afterStyle;\n      var beforeElementType = _props.beforeElementType;\n      var // eslint-disable-line no-unused-vars\n      afterElementType = _props.afterElementType;\n      var // eslint-disable-line no-unused-vars\n      elementType = _props.elementType;\n\n      var other = _objectWithoutProperties(_props, ['beforeStyle', 'afterStyle', 'beforeElementType', 'afterElementType', 'elementType']);\n\n      var prepareStyles = this.context.muiTheme.prepareStyles;\n\n\n      var beforeElement = void 0;\n      var afterElement = void 0;\n\n      if (beforeStyle) {\n        beforeElement = _react2.default.createElement(this.props.beforeElementType, {\n          style: prepareStyles((0, _simpleAssign2.default)({}, styles.box, beforeStyle)),\n          key: '::before'\n        });\n      }\n\n      if (afterStyle) {\n        afterElement = _react2.default.createElement(this.props.afterElementType, {\n          style: prepareStyles((0, _simpleAssign2.default)({}, styles.box, afterStyle)),\n          key: '::after'\n        });\n      }\n\n      var children = [beforeElement, this.props.children, afterElement];\n\n      var props = other;\n      props.style = prepareStyles((0, _simpleAssign2.default)({}, this.props.style));\n\n      return _react2.default.createElement(this.props.elementType, props, children);\n    }\n  }]);\n\n  return BeforeAfterWrapper;\n}(_react.Component);\n\nBeforeAfterWrapper.propTypes = {\n  afterElementType: _react.PropTypes.string,\n  afterStyle: _react.PropTypes.object,\n  beforeElementType: _react.PropTypes.string,\n  beforeStyle: _react.PropTypes.object,\n  children: _react.PropTypes.node,\n  elementType: _react.PropTypes.string,\n  /**\n   * Override the inline-styles of the root element.\n   */\n  style: _react.PropTypes.object\n};\nBeforeAfterWrapper.defaultProps = {\n  beforeElementType: 'div',\n  afterElementType: 'div',\n  elementType: 'div'\n};\nBeforeAfterWrapper.contextTypes = {\n  muiTheme: _react.PropTypes.object.isRequired\n};\nexports.default = BeforeAfterWrapper;\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./~/material-ui/internal/BeforeAfterWrapper.js\n ** module id = 259\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","'use strict';\n\nObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", {\n  value: true\n});\n\nvar _extends = Object.assign || function (target) { for (var i = 1; i < arguments.length; i++) { var source = arguments[i]; for (var key in source) { if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(source, key)) { target[key] = source[key]; } } } return target; };\n\nvar _createClass = function () { function defineProperties(target, props) { for (var i = 0; i < props.length; i++) { var descriptor = props[i]; descriptor.enumerable = descriptor.enumerable || false; descriptor.configurable = true; if (\"value\" in descriptor) descriptor.writable = true; Object.defineProperty(target, descriptor.key, descriptor); } } return function (Constructor, protoProps, staticProps) { if (protoProps) defineProperties(Constructor.prototype, protoProps); if (staticProps) defineProperties(Constructor, staticProps); return Constructor; }; }();\n\nvar _simpleAssign = require('simple-assign');\n\nvar _simpleAssign2 = _interopRequireDefault(_simpleAssign);\n\nvar _react = require('react');\n\nvar _react2 = _interopRequireDefault(_react);\n\nvar _reactDom = require('react-dom');\n\nvar _reactDom2 = _interopRequireDefault(_reactDom);\n\nvar _shallowEqual = require('recompose/shallowEqual');\n\nvar _shallowEqual2 = _interopRequireDefault(_shallowEqual);\n\nvar _autoPrefix = require('../utils/autoPrefix');\n\nvar _autoPrefix2 = _interopRequireDefault(_autoPrefix);\n\nvar _transitions = require('../styles/transitions');\n\nvar _transitions2 = _interopRequireDefault(_transitions);\n\nfunction _interopRequireDefault(obj) { return obj && obj.__esModule ?
